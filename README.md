# Final project outline

In this final project I am going to study the influence of the socio-economic status, on the language proficiency in children who are learning the English language. This can be relevant to identify the underlying source of a slowed language development in children. I am going to look if there is a significant diffrence in language proficiency between children who come from families with a high and low socio-economcic status. 

## Background information



## Research question and hypotheses

How does the difference in socio-economic status influence the language proficiency level in children learning the English language?

Children with a low socio-economic status have a lower language proficiency level than children with a high socio-economic status.
