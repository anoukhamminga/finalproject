# Final project outline

In this final project I am going to study the influence of the socio-economic status, on the language proficiency in children who are learning the English language. This can be relevant to identify the underlying source of a slowed language development in children. I am going to look if there is a significant diffrence in language proficiency between children who come from families with a high and low socio-economcic status.
